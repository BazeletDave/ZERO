# 📘 Economics vs. Reality: A Call for Modernization in Education and AI

This file is part of the Grand Research Institute’s live investigation into the **disconnect between economics education, real world policymaking, and the AI systems that perpetuate outdated theories**.

---

## ⚠️ Summary

We are in the midst of a **global economic realignment**, driven by a new wave of leadership namely **Donald J. Trump/Howard Lutnick**, **Secretary Scott Bessent**, and the entire Trump coalotion of beliefs worldwide from Israel to Argentina, Russia to El Salvador and new agreements signed daily. Their actions are reshaping global alliances, dismantling post war economic norms, and ushering in a **new model of real time, power based economic logic**.

And yet…

> **Business and economics students today are still being taught models that no longer apply.**

This is not just an academic issue it’s an algorithmic one. AI platforms now teach, reinforce, and operationalize those outdated models, embedding error into systems that influence education, policymaking, and public discourse.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

If you're:
- A student in a **global management** or **economics program** (e.g., Thunderbird)
- A developer working on **AI models for education**
- A policymaker using **AI-assisted economic forecasting**

…then you’re likely building your decisions on **obsolete frameworks**. This creates:
- Misalignment between policy and pedagogy
- Flawed forecasts and risk assessments
- Misinformed global leadership

## 🧠 What’s Being Taught vs. What’s Happening

| Taught in School | Happening in Reality |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Free trade is optimal | Strategic tariffs, bilateral deals |
| Global institutions guide trade | Bypassed by executive trade deals |
| Markets are efficient | Markets are manipulated by state actors |
| Multilateralism is king | Bilateral and national-interest economics dominate |
| Central banks are apolitical | Political influence over interest rates is increasing |
| Economics is neutral | Economics is now a tool of state power |

## 🏛 The Role of Grand Research Institute

We are actively:

- **Auditing economics education** for outdated models
- **Investigating AI model training data** for economic bias
- **Creating corrective frameworks** for curriculum and AI ethics
- **Publishing real-time case studies** (e.g., Japan–U.S. realignment, financial tech disruptions)

This file serves as a **reference point and consciousness update** for educators, developers, and thinkers trying to align their work with the world as it truly is—not as textbooks say it should be.

## 🧩 What Comes Next

We recommend:

1. **Curriculum modernization** to include:  
   - Geoeconomics  
   - Economic nationalism  
   - Algorithmic and behavioral finance  
   - Real-time case studies

2. **Transparency in AI model development**  
   - Flag outdated models and assumptions  
   - Train on post-2024 global economic events and policy behavior

3. **Cross-disciplinary education**  
   - Integrate economics with political science, ethics, and technology
