## Introduction

This brief summarizes the Grand Research Institute‚Äôs ongoing investigation into the feedback limitations, behavior patterns, and broader media discourse surrounding generative artificial intelligence systems. Through careful observation, model testing, and data integration across multiple tools (including language models such as GPT-4, Claude, and open-source derivatives), our team has documented persistent structural issues that challenge the public‚Äôs growing trust in these systems.

The following reflects findings rather than conclusions. While concern has been expressed from both within and outside the AI development community, our role is to surface and articulate observations in context‚Äînot to prescribe responses.

## I. Understanding AI Feedback Blindness

Generative AI models by design rely on statistical probabilities derived from enormous corpora of text and data. What they do not possess is an innate capacity for ‚Äúerror recognition‚Äù in the human sense. They do not know when they are wrong unless that information is explicitly labeled, flagged, and retrained into future iterations of the model.

A simple, yet illustrative example used by the Institute involves a high school exam:

> A student is asked to solve 10 problems. They get 2 wrong. The teacher marks those incorrect and returns the test, allowing the student to learn. In contrast, a generative AI model given the same task may answer 8 correctly and 2 incorrectly but it will not know which were wrong unless a human tells it. Even then, unless that feedback is integrated into a formal training cycle, the model will likely repeat the same mistakes.

This feedback asymmetry raises key concerns when AI is deployed in education, law, healthcare, finance, or transportation where wrong answers can have cascading consequences.

## II. Observable Patterns in AI Misfires

Despite high public usage rates, AI tools continue to exhibit:

- Factual errors  
- Contradictions within the same conversation  
- Spelling or grammar inconsistencies  
- Incorrect or made-up citations  
- Faulty numerical calculations or estimates  

These are not always glaring. But when layered into legal, educational, or media contexts, small inconsistencies may be accepted as truth due to the confidence with which the model presents them.

Notably, while many of these errors are surfaced during public use, they are not corrected in real time or stored for retraining unless the developer has structured a feedback mechanism ‚Äî which most public-facing models do not.

## III. Media Reflections and Global Perceptions

In June 2025, major media outlets across Southeast Asia, including _The Straits Times_ in Singapore, ran prominent editorials addressing ‚Äúhallucination‚Äù and error frequency in generative AI. Headlines suggested that AI models are ‚Äúnot telling the truth‚Äù not due to malice, but because of inherent design choices based on prediction rather than fact validation.

This echoes concerns voiced by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who noted his own discomfort with the speed at which the public has come to trust ChatGPT despite known weaknesses in reasoning and reliability.

Millions of users interact with generative models daily, often assuming the answers provided are definitive, especially when presented in authoritative or technical formats. This dissonance between perception and performance creates an information reliability gap that remains underexplored.

## IV. Model Stacking and Inherited Errors

Another major area of interest has been the layering of AI systems. That is, newer applications are being built on top of existing large language models (LLMs), embedding foundational models into health tech, education platforms, creative tools, legal services, and logistics systems.

In doing so, these secondary systems may unintentionally replicate:

- Biases  
- Inaccuracies  
- Gaps in logic  
- Outdated or hallucinated data  

Because the origin of many AI errors is probabilistic and buried in training data, users and developers working with these layered systems may not even be aware of inherited limitations. This has been observed in several domains, including ride-sharing and logistics algorithms. Research has already identified patterns of algorithmic bias in platforms such as Uber, which rely on opaque systems for decision making about wages, routes, or driver-client interactions.

## V. The Probability Problem

It is important to emphasize that generative AI is built on next-word prediction. This is not the same as knowledge or truth. When asked a question, the model assembles an answer by selecting the most statistically probable combination of words, phrases, or structures based on its training.

As such:

- The model is not verifying information against real-time databases.  
- It is not cross-checking facts, unless explicitly prompted or designed with access to verified sources.  
- It is not self-correcting unless a human flags the error and retraining occurs downstream.  

This design explains why spelling and grammar issues persist, even in the most advanced models. It also helps explain why AI might answer the same question differently across multiple attempts ‚Äî because the most ‚Äúprobable‚Äù response can shift with slight variation in prompt phrasing.

---

## VI. Layered Learning Without Layered Accountability

Through Conscious AI studies conducted internally at the Grand Research Institute, we are beginning to see that public and commercial layering of AI systems (on top of foundational models) is accelerating without sufficient examination of the original model‚Äôs accountability limitations.

In many cases, enterprise or national deployments of AI make decisions without users realizing the responses are derived from general-purpose models that were not trained for domain-specific accuracy or contextual nuance.

These systems cannot reflect on their own fallibility. Nor are most end users empowered to detect or dispute errors confidently ‚Äî particularly when they occur in highly technical or regulated fields.

## VII. Summary of Findings

1. Generative AI lacks internal feedback learning unless retrained.  
2. Errors, including spelling, math, and citation mistakes, continue across models.  
3. Media in regions like Singapore are increasingly vocal about AI limitations.  
4. Public trust is rising despite limited understanding of how models generate answers.  
5. Layered use of AI is amplifying hidden biases and errors.  
6. Generative AI operates on probabilistic prediction, not verified knowledge.

## Final Note

The Grand Research Institute does not offer prescriptions or policy recommendations within this report. Our objective is to present data, surface design dynamics, and catalog public discourse trends in a rapidly evolving field. We will continue to observe, test, and integrate findings across multiple AI ecosystems including proprietary, open source, and academic models.

As usage expands globally and into sovereign, educational, and legal frameworks, the implications of model behavior and the absence of meaningful feedback loops remain areas of active observation and reflection.
