# ZERO: Rebuilding the Global Economic Framework from Scratch

**ZERO** is an open source research initiative built around the urgent need to reimagine global economics from the ground up. We begin at **zero** discarding legacy metrics like GDP and labor participation, and instead focusing on real world influence, narrative impact, gig labor, AI, platform economies, and geostrategic deals that define the post-COVID, post industrial world.

This is not theory. This is the real economy.

## 🌍 Purpose

Post-COVID economics is not the same economics. We live in a world where:

- $150B+ in U.S. tariffs barely scratch the surface of what’s really shifting global power.
- Deals between the U.S. and India, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Argentina, and the EU have changed the world but are mostly invisible in GDP.
- AI and platforms like Uber and Mad Impact have rewritten the nature of labor and value but remain off the books of official metrics.
- The Trump administration is shaping the global economy daily not just through policy, but through narrative, negotiation, and geopolitical leverage.

ZERO exists to measure **what matters now** not just what was counted before.

## 🔧 What We Do

ZERO is a framework, not a single index. Our mission is to create:

- Alternative dashboards to GDP and labor statistics
- Strategic deal maps that show how power really moves
- New metrics that include gig work, user generated value, AI productivity, and political influence
- Scenario planning tools that connect macro narratives with real world economic impact

## 🔍 Core Concepts

### 📉 Post-GDP Thinking
Traditional GDP doesn’t count:

- Free digital services (Google, AI tools, ChatGPT)
- Platform based labor (Uber, DoorDash, Fiverr)
- Global data flows, crypto, or digital attention
- Influence pacts, defense agreements, or AI adoption

### 🤝 Deal-Driven Diplomacy
We track international deals that affect entire industries but remain off the GDP radar:

- **U.S.–Saudi Arabia**: Arms deals, energy ties, and petrodollar diplomacy
- **U.S.–India**: Tech corridors, supply chain relocation, and medical exports
- **U.S.–EU**: Strategic tariff arrangements, soybean diplomacy, and regulatory realignment
- **U.S.–Israel**: Cybersecurity, VC pipeline expansion, and military tech
- **U.S.–Argentina**: Commodities, lithium, and food exports shaping inflation globally

These are not just trade deals they are **influence engines**.

### 🧠 Platform and AI Economics
Platforms like Uber and gig apps have redefined labor:

- Misclassified jobs inflate employment numbers while hiding economic instability
- AI reduces labor demand, yet AI-driven value (like data training, prompt engineering) is not counted
- Real-time digital work is invisible in national accounting

This leads to a massive **disconnect between lived reality and reported economic performance**.

### 📊 Narrative Economics
Speech now moves markets. We track economic impact not just from actions—but from **words**.

- Trump, Howard Lutnick (Cantor Fitzgerald), and Commerce leaders like Besant move currencies, commodities, and public opinion
- Market perception is shaped faster by narrative than by formal regulation

## 🌐 Global Scope

ZERO is a global project, with focus on:

- **United States**: Central hub of narrative economics and deal-driven diplomacy
- **India**: Rising power in digital labor and manufacturing shifts
- **Saudi Arabia & the Gulf**: Major influence through strategic capital and defense deals
- **European Union**: Caught between regulatory control and U.S.-China influence tug-of-war
- **China (PRC)**: Platform-state model built on surveillance, AI, and infrastructure export
- **Latin America & Africa**: Extraction economies reshaped by new digital dependencies

---

## 🧠 Why ZERO?

Because the world has changed and our economics haven’t.

The disconnect between reported numbers and lived reality grows daily. GDP is rising, but inequality, automation, and instability are rising faster. Uber drivers and gig workers are logged as "employed," but live with volatility, no benefits, and declining purchasing power. The AI that displaces them isn’t counted as productive, but it is shaping every industry.

We must confront this gap and fix it.
